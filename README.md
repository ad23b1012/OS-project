# Deep Learning-Based Chest X-ray Abnormality Detection

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia and other chest X-ray abnormalities using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with transfer learning techniques. The model is trained on publicly available medical image datasets and achieves a high detection accuracy of **94.6%**.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Developed a custom CNN-based model with transfer learning for classifying chest X-ray images.
- Achieved a validation accuracy of **94.6%**.
- Integrated **Grad-CAM** visualizations to provide interpretability and assist medical professionals in diagnosis.
- Focused on building a reliable and interpretable system for use in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
